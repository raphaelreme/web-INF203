Question 1a:
When we look at the source code, it displays the real code of the page whereas inspect the page display how the browser interprets it.
In this example the source code is only the text "My personal page from Telecom ParisTech". But when the page is inspected, the browser adds the basic tags of HTML.


Question 1b:
//

Question 1c:
The browser does not display the title on the page. (It is meta information)
In fact the page that the browser displays is the content of body.
The content of head is metainformation about the page.

Question 1d:
//

Question 1e:
//

Question 1f:
We can forget a </div> tag. But not the </h1> tag.
Indeed the browser will put the closing tag the fastest he can.

With a </div> it doesn't change anything to the rendering (but does change the dom tree).
But with </h1>, all the <div> element are then inside it and are display therefore bigger.

Question 2a:

Question 2b:
All the style is group at one place which is a good thing.
We also can apply the same style to several components.
And it also allows to have a more lisible code in the body part !

But it is may be harder to see the real and final style of a component.

Question 2c:
Having the html separated from the css is a good thing because it allows us
to change all the style easily (just change the stylesheet src). We can also
apply the same stylesheet to different html page ! And we can easily have a stylesheet
for each type of screen.
